# PipeCamelCase1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.4. This is a custom Angular pipe that transforms text strings into **camelCase** format. It's useful for normalizing user input or generating consistent variable-style naming in templates.

The camelCase format transforms a string like:
"hello world angular" → "helloWorldAngular"

This pipe is intended to be used within an existing Angular project. Copy the `camelCase1.ts` file into your `pipes` folder (e.g. `src/app/pipes`).

Make sure it’s marked as a **standalone** pipe.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
